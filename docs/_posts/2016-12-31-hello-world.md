My life has in many ways revolved around maps. As a child, pouring over atlases and imagining what traveling along the Amazon would be like. In my youth, participating in orienteering events, in the most remote places, all over Europe. Later, studying geography and being on the forefront of the digital revolution in cartography and the evolution of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Still, I think that we have in many ways only scratched the surface of what is possible in understanding how the world works and the human impact on our earth. As technology continuously evolves, we will undoubtedly invent better and faster ways to process information leading to new scientific breakthroughs in this realm. Indeed, the global challenges of our time demands it.

It is my hope that this project may have even a minuscule impact on this quest.
